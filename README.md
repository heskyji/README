# Hesky README

## What is this?
This README is my User Guide to my colleagues, especially my direct reports. It explains some basics of my style of working and leadership. I hope this helps establishing an open and trusting relationship with the readers and holding myself accountable in those relationships.

## About Me
1. I'm an introvert ([ISFJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality)). English is my second language. Me being quiet rarely means my level of interest or engagement is low.

1. I'm a perfectionist deep inside. Sometimes I can't help myself digging into too much details and pursuing complex solutions.   

## My personal values
1. I believe in “people over processes over tools” and it applies in a broad professional context beyond just an Agile manifesto.

1. I believe in "work to live" not "live to work". I have a young family and they are my number one priority.

1. I value open and down-to-earth conversations aiming for exchanging ideas or solving problems.

## Feedback
You're most welcomed to give me feedback on what I said or did, my work, my decisions, our relationship, my way of working, my leadership style - anything really.

I treat feedbacks as gifts. I value any type of feedbacks, in particular negative or constructive ones, as long as they're direct. I'm totally comfortable with people being blunt with me.

I will listen and I will learn from your feedbacks.

## I am available
If you need my time, schedule something in the calendar is ideal. However, I don't mind to be interrupted, so don't hesitate to pull me off the desk or grab me in the corridor when needed.

## Calendar / Meeting Invite
My calendar is set to be visible for anyone within the organisation. So you should be able to see at what time I'm having what meeting with whom.

If you want to schedule a meeting with me, I will be available if my calendar says so; vice-versa.

## One-on-ones

I believe in that 1:1 is primarily about the report, only secondarily about the manager. As my report, I expect you to use 1:1 to discuss your needs, your ambitions and your ideas.

## For my reports
1. I believe in that performance is measured by genuine effort and the impact of the outcome, not the amount of time spent.

1. I expect you to find the root cause of problems before thinking or applying resolution.

1. I expect you to come to me when you have a problem or need help.  

1. I believe in over-communicate, in contrast of under-communicate. So, please over-communicate with me. Especially for people that work remotely to me (from home or in another location).

1. I expect you to invest in yourself and value self-improvement.

1. I expect you to genuinely value and respect your teammates, invest effort and empathy to build a trusting work relationship with them.

## Work Life Balance
1. Do whatever you need to do for your family, health, home, trade and etc. and shuffle your hours around occasionally and temporarily is totally fine with me.

1. I do not ask you to work outside normal office hours, unless I believe it's absolutely necessary. On the occasion after-hours work is required, I will do my best to make considerate and reasonable arrangement.
